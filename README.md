# SQL_queries
This SQL based project is based on a fake company called Rockbuster. They are trying to answer a few key questions they have about their current customers: 
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Through multiple exercies, I was able to answer the questions and put together visuals for the final project.
